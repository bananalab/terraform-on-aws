# Set up your development environment.

## Code editor
Like most development environments Terraform is completely text based.  Therefore you will need a text editor.  In this class we'll be using Microsoft VSCode.

Install:

> ðŸ“˜ There are other plugins available for Terraform development, but these are the official Hashicorp versions.

## Other tools.
There is an ecosystem of tools to help develop Terraform code.  We'll be using a few of these, but they're all worth checking out.

## Check your AWS settings.
> ðŸ“˜ A full walk through of setting up AWS accounts is outside the scope of the training, but you should be able to run:

`aws sts get-caller-identity`

to verify it's configured as you expect.
